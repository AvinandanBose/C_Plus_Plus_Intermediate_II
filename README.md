<h1>Arrays</h1>
<h3>1.An Array is a group of logically related data items of same data types addressed by a common name .</h3>
<h3>2.All items in array stored in contiguous (physically adjacent) memory locations. </h3>
<h3>3.As array stored in contiguous(physically adjacent)memory location , we can traverse all the elements(data items) in single run , hence Arrays falls under 
<ins>Linear Data Structure</ins>. </h3>

```Syntax: 
Syntax:<dataType> arrayName[<arraySize>]

Note: ArraySize is the total indexes that Array can have data items / elements stored. 
Each elements are accessed by their individual index values.</i>

<h2> 1. One Dimensional Array </h2>

```Syntax: 
Syntax:<dataType> arrayName[<arraySize>â†’<Column Size/Row Size>]

<h3>As One Dimensional Array is expandible either row wise or column wise as we can project according to its array size(i.e. Single Directional) , hence to be called as : "Vector". A One-Dimensional Array is the simplest form of an Array in which the elements are stored linearly and can be accessed individually by specifying the index value of each element stored in the array.  </h3>
